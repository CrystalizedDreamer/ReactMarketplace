This React Project represents my journey into using react. 
Admittedly, I was so daunted by taking on the task, so this also represents my Journeys with the app MIMO to help me understand react better and practice while away from my main setup and it has done me wonders.

The site I have made comprises of three components and some light CSS work.

The parent component houses the information or "state"
the recieves them and mapped them
and the last displayed them as individual cards.

For some reason in my mind I had convinced myself that the objects each had to be a memeber of an unordered list, and traces of that still linger in the CSS
However, this was removed and the projects were organized in a grid based format.

No navbar was made for this site, nor a footer nor a header, simply because to my understanding I needed to just practice the basics of using REACT more.
At first I was apprehensive, as I came to enjoy the complexities and oddities that come with designing a site ground up with HTML but now that I've tasted how much easier REACT feels on the hand, I think I'm going to really enjoy further practices.
